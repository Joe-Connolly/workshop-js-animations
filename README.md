### Buzzfeed Quiz
This quiz is about which member of the Rose family (from my favorite TV show, Schitt's Creek) you would be. I styled it as if it was branded content from the TV show, so the colors and fonts match their styling - and each question header has a little logo to remind users that its about the TV show. I am really proud of this styling, and I also worked hard on getting the different states for each answer to look different. One thing that worked really well was my JSON/JS "choose your own adventure" part, as that made my index file way smaller and logically made a lot more sense to me, as everything was abstracted out.
I definitely had a hard time getting the JSON to translate perfectly and had to play around with the structure of my classes a bit - I think some of my JS functions to append to different divs could've been a bit smoother.
Screen caps of things I am proud of:
I already mentioned my styling, and I think my results modal shows that color scheme in a subtle way that really ties back to the show.
